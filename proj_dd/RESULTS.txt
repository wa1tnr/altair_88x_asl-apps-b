 PC   = 0C82 = [78 B1 CA] = MOV A,B
 SP   = 3AFE = [A0 0C 9B 10 9B 10 EC 10]
 regA = 00 regS = 80 = S.......
 regB = 01 regC = 8F regD = 3E regE = 71 regH = 00 regL = 00

PC 0C82 is the return point of a loop near FILL iirc.

The program runs for some time in this loop.

Due to CP/M implementation, not testing much further;
was an exercise mostly in compilation of a complete
8080 assembler program of some complexity.

Use as a reference for (much, much) simpler work to come. ;)

END.
